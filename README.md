# odin-recipes
First HTML Project

Assignment:

Iteration 1: initial structure
Within the odin-recipes directory, create an index.html file.
Fill it out with the usual boilerplate HTML and add an h1 heading "Odin Recipes" to the body.

Iteration 2: recipe page
Create a new directory within the odin-recipes directory and name it recipes.
Create a new HTML file within the recipes directory and name it after the recipe it will contain.
Back in the index.html file, add a link to the recipe page you just created. The text of the link should again be the recipe name.

Iteration 3: recipe page content
Your new recipe page should have the following content:
- An image of the finished dish under the h1 heading that you added earlier.
- Under the image, it should have an appropriately sized "Description" heading followed by a paragraph or two describing the recipe.
- Under the description, add an "Ingredients" heading followed by an unordered list of the ingredients needed for the recipe.
- Finally, under the ingredients list, add a "Steps" heading followed by an ordered list of the steps needed for making the dish.

Iteration 4: add more recipes
Add two more recipes with identical page structures to the recipe page you've already created.
