        <!--Description-->
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Kebab is roasted meat that originates from the Middle East and has been popularised by <strong>Iranian, Arabic and Turkish</strong> cuisine. Many variants of the category are popular around the world, including the <em>skewered shish kebab</em> and the <em>doner kebab</em> with bread.</p>
        <p>Kebabs consist of cut up or ground meat, sometimes with vegetables and various other accompaniments according to the specific recipe. Although kebabs are typically cooked on a skewer over a fire, some kebab dishes are oven-baked in a pan, or prepared as a stew such as tas kebab.</p>
        <!--Ingredients-->
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup whole-milk Greek yogurt</li>
            <li>6 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice, or more to taste</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons passata</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon Aleppo red pepper flakes</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons ground cumin</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
            <li>⅛ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>2 ½ pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs, halved</li>
            <li>4 long metal skewers</li>
        </ul>
        <!--Steps-->
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk yogurt, garlic, olive oil, lemon juice, ketchup, red pepper flakes, salt, cumin, black pepper, paprika, and cinnamon together in a large bowl.</li>
            <li>Place chicken thigh halves into the yogurt marinade and coat them thoroughly on all sides. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate, 2 to 8 hours.</li>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
            <li>Using 2 skewers for each kebab, thread half of the chicken thighs onto each pair of skewers making a fairly thick "log" shape.</li>
            <li>Place kebabs on the preheated grill. Do not try to turn them until they begin to unstick from the grill, 3 or 4 minutes. Turn kebabs and grill the other side for 3 to 4 minutes. Continue cooking and turning until chicken is no longer pink in the center, about 6 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
